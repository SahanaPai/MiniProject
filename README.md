A web-based application that uses a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) for accurate and real-time pneumonia detection from chest X-ray images.
Built with Python (Flask) for the backend and HTML/CSS for the frontend, the system integrates Grad-CAM for explainable AI visualizations.

Features include:
Automated diagnosis of bacterial, viral, and normal lung conditions
Data preprocessing & augmentation for model robustness
Secure patient data handling
Scalable deployment for healthcare and telemedicine use

Tech Stack: Python, Flask, TensorFlow/Keras, NumPy, Pandas, OpenCV, HTML, CSS
Dataset: Publicly available chest X-ray datasets (Kaggle, hospital records)
